# UML

UML diagrams can be a great tool of communication

Use a diagram when you need to think about something, share ideas with someone else, save an idea for the future, show management the work you've been doing, when you can't find a bug in code, or when your teacher/adviser requires it.

You can use the UML to make rough sketches, to express a blueprint of the code, as input to a code generator, or as required documentation of a finished project.

A nice tool for documentation
