# codingForDummies

[![tokei](https://tokei.rs/b1/github/duken72/codingForDummies)](https://github.com/duken72/codingForDummies)

Important things about coding that I have learnt by myself and from the professionals. Overall, this is more like a collection of notes from different sources. Others have already done an amazing job of explaining stuffs. Let's not re-invent the wheel. It's just that .. everything by themselves is scatterred everywhere .. Perhaps this would make your search a bit more directed.

- This README contains general terms or problems.
- Other folders contain guides and samples for specific coding languages, tools and possible terminal commands.
